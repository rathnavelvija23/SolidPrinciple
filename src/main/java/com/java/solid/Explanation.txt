Single Responsibility Principle:

The Single Responsibility Principle states that every Java class must perform single functionality.
Implementation of multiple functionlities in a single class mashup the code.

One method inside one class


Open-Closed Principle:

Open for extension and closed for modification.

Class having three methods based on type(input - car,personal,home loan)
Create interface for the getloan method
create 3 different service class and implments inside it


Liskov Substitution Principle:

It applies to Inheritance - the derived class must be completely substitutable for their base classes

If Class B is subtype of Class A . Then we should be able to replace A with B.

Create Abstract class with multiple methods and one of the service will not implemnet the method and it cannpt replace it
create two interface and specific method into it
implement whichever needed.


Interface segregation:

We should not force client to implement the methods from interface which is not irrelavant

Segregate the method into different interfaces


Dependency INversion

High level module should not depend on low level modules . Both should depend on abstarction

Create common interface like BankCard for both credit and debit
BankCard b = new DebitCard() -> which will do runtime calling.
